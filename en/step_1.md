## Introduction

You are going to make a game in which players have to guide a wand along a course without making contact. Making contact will add one to the player's score - the player with the lowest score wins!

__Instructions__: If you're reading this online, press __A__ on the micro:bit below to start the game, and then touch pin __0__ to make a connection.

For this project you'll need some additional items:

+ Metal wire (approx. 50cm);
+ Modelling clay (Plasticine or similar, needs to be non-conductive);
+ Electrical tape (optional);
+ Crocodile clip leads (optional).

## Introduction:
In this project, children will learn how to use variables in making a wire-following game. The aim of the game is to guide a wand along a course without making contact. Making contact will add one to the player's score - the player with the lowest score wins.

## Resources

To complete this project, children will need:

+ Metal wire (approx. 50cm);
+ Putty;
+ Electrical tape (optional);
+ Crocodile leads (optional).

Steps 1 and 2 of this project can be completed without this equipment.

For this project, the [MakeCode (PXT)](http://jumpto.cc/pxt-new) microbit editor should be used.

You can find a completed version of this project at [makecode.microbit.org/#pub:71088-38400-20107-39742](https://makecode.microbit.org/#pub:71088-38400-20107-39742), and the compiled .hex file can be downloaded by clicking the 'Download Project Materials' link for this project, which contains:

+ Frustration.hex

## Learning Objectives
+ Variables;
+ Input/output (I/O) pins.

This project covers elements from the following strands of the [Raspberry Pi Digital Making Curriculum](http://rpf.io/curriculum):

+ [Use basic programming constructs to create simple programs.](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/programming/creator)

+ [Use basic digital, analogue, and electromechanical components.](https://www.raspberrypi.org/curriculum/physical-computing/creator)

## Challenges
+ "Display an image" - Display an image on the micro:bit before the number of `fails` is displayed.
+ "Cheat mode!" - Subtract 1 from the `fails` variable when button B is pressed.
+ "Personalise your game" - Make changes to the wand and course in order to make the game more difficult.
