## Building your game

Now that you've coded your game, let's put it all together!



+ First, let's make your wand. Take a piece of wire about 20cm long and bend it in half, making a loop at the top.

+ You can then twist the two pieces of wire together.

+ To make the course, take another piece of wire about 30cm long and bend the middle part of the wire into shape. You should bend up one end of the course.

+ If you have some electrical tape, wrap some around the two ends of the wire, leaving some exposed metal at both ends.

+ Slide your wand through your course, and push the ends of your wire into some putty to stand it up.

+ You can now connect your game to your micro:bit using a crocodile clip lead or some wire. Firstly, connect the ground pin (GND) to one end of your course.

+ You can then connect Pin 0 to your wand.

+ Test your game. Press button A and your score should be set to 0. Each time your wand touches the course, the circuit is completed and your micro:bit should add 1 to your number of fails.
